1. O_CREATE without mode, the persmission of the file will be undefined.

2. using open("test.txt", O_CREAT|O_RDWR, S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR) twice:
	It overwrites the orignal file.
		if the write_size_2 < write_size_1
			&& the buffer_nr_full_2 < buffer_nr_full_1
				we can see part of the buffer1 content in the file

3. O_APPEDN AND O_TRUNC can be used together but meaningless
